# Agentic Web Framework

**Agentic Web Framework** is a TypeScript SDK that allows you to turn any website into an **autonomous agentic experience**.

It provides a "Concierge" for your users—an AI that can navigate, scroll, narrate, and explain your content, ensuring no user ever gets lost or misses key information.

## Quick Start

```bash
npx create-agentic-app my-new-site
```

## Features

- **🧠 Deterministic Brain**: Powered by XState for robust navigation logic.
- **🌉 Bridge Protocol**: Connects LLMs to the DOM with self-healing capabilities.
- **🛡️ PII Protection**: Automatically sanitizes data before LLM processing.
- **🎥 Flight Recorder**: Full session telemetry for debugging.
