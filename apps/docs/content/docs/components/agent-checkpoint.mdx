description: Mark DOM waypoints for the agent to navigate and narrate
---

# AgentCheckpoint

`AgentCheckpoint` marks meaningful sections of your UI as waypoints. The agent will navigate to each checkpoint in order and deliver narration.

## Import

```tsx
import { AgentCheckpoint } from '@agentic-zero/core'
```

## Usage

```tsx
<AgentCheckpoint
  id="pricing"
  narrative="Let me walk you through our pricing plans."
>
  <section className="pricing">
    <h2>Pricing</h2>
    {/* Your pricing content */}
  </section>
</AgentCheckpoint>
```

## Props

| Prop | Type | Required | Description |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| `id` | `string` | Yes | Unique identifier for this checkpoint |
| `narrative` | `string` | No | Default narration text for this checkpoint |
| `children` | `React.ReactNode` | Yes | The UI content to wrap |

## How It Works

1. The component registers itself with the agent brain on mount
2. During scanning, the brain discovers all checkpoints in DOM order
3. During navigation, the agent scrolls the checkpoint into view
4. During narration, the `narrative` prop (or an LLM-generated alternative) is streamed

## Alternative: Data Attributes

You can also mark checkpoints without the component wrapper:

```tsx
<section
  data-agent-checkpoint="pricing"
  data-agent-narrative="Check out our pricing plans."
>
  <h2>Pricing</h2>
</section>
```

## Multiple Checkpoints Example

```tsx
export default function LandingPage() {
  return (
    <>
      <AgentCheckpoint id="hero" narrative="Welcome to our platform.">
        <HeroSection />
      </AgentCheckpoint>

      <AgentCheckpoint id="features" narrative="Here are our key features.">
        <FeaturesSection />
      </AgentCheckpoint>

      <AgentCheckpoint id="pricing" narrative="Let's look at pricing.">
        <PricingSection />
      </AgentCheckpoint>

      <AgentCheckpoint id="cta" narrative="Ready to get started?">
        <CTASection />
      </AgentCheckpoint>
    </>
  )
}
```
