# Installation

## Requirements

- **Node.js** 18 or later
- **React** 18 or later
- **React DOM** 18 or later

## Install the SDK

Add `@agentic-zero/core` to your existing project:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @agentic-zero/core
```

## Peer Dependencies

The SDK requires React as a peer dependency. If you don't already have React installed:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install react react-dom
```

## Framework Dependencies

`@agentic-zero/core` bundles the following dependencies internally — you don't need to install them separately:

| Package | Purpose |
|:--|:--|
| `xstate` / `@xstate/react` | Brain state machine |
| `three` / `@react-three/fiber` / `@react-three/drei` | 3D holographic avatars |
| `framer-motion` | Animations |
| `gsap` | Advanced scroll/timeline animations |
| `ai` (Vercel AI SDK) | Streaming LLM narrative |
| `lucide-react` | Icons |

## Verify Installation

After installing, verify the package is available:

```tsx
import { AgenticProvider } from '@agentic-zero/core'
// ✅ No errors — you're ready to go!
```
