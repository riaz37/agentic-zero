# Interruption Manager

The `InterruptionManager` handles the "tug-of-war" between the AI agent and the human user. When a user scrolls, clicks, or otherwise interacts while the agent is running, the manager gracefully pauses and re-engages.

## Import

```ts
import { InterruptionManager } from '@agentic-zero/core'
import type { InterruptionState } from '@agentic-zero/core'
```

## InterruptionState

```ts
interface InterruptionState {
  /** Whether the agent is currently interrupted */
  isInterrupted: boolean
  /** Type of user action that caused the interruption */
  cause: 'scroll' | 'click' | 'keyboard' | 'manual' | null
  /** Timestamp of the interruption */
  interruptedAt: number | null
  /** How long the agent has been interrupted (ms) */
  duration: number
}
```

## How It Works

### Detection

The manager listens for user interaction events:

- **Scroll** — User scrolls the page while the agent is navigating
- **Click** — User clicks an element while the agent is active
- **Keyboard** — User presses keys during narration
- **Manual** — User explicitly pauses via UI controls

### Response

When an interruption is detected:

1. **Pause** — The agent immediately pauses its current action
2. **Yield** — The agent yields control to the user
3. **Watch** — The manager watches for user inactivity
4. **Re-engage** — After a configurable timeout, the agent offers to resume

### The Tug-of-War

```
Agent is navigating...
  User scrolls → Agent pauses
    User stops scrolling...
      3 seconds of inactivity → Agent offers to resume
        User clicks "Resume" → Agent continues
        User scrolls again → Timer resets
```

## Design Principle

The agent should never **fight** the user for control. If a user wants to explore, the agent steps back. If the user stops, the agent politely offers to continue.
