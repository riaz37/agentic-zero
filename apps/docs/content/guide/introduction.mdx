# Introduction

The **Agentic Web Framework** is designed to bridge the gap between static web content and active AI guidance.

Legacy chatbots sit in a bubble at the bottom right of your screen. **Agentic Web** puts the agent *in the page*, controlling the scroll, highlighting elements, and guiding the user through a narrative journey.

## Why?

Websites are complex. Users get lost. They miss the "Pricing" section, or they don't understand the "Features" grid.

An Agentic Website solves this by:
1.  **Guiding**: Taking the user by the hand (scroll) to the right place.
2.  **Narrating**: Explaining what they are seeing in context.
3.  **Reacting**: Handling interruptions and questions naturally.
